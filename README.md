## CLV-and-CLV-Prediction

What is Customer Lifetime Value(CLV)?

The monetary value a customer will bring to a company during their relationship and communication is known as "customer lifetime value."

We will achieve this by using the formulas below:

Repeat rate: number of customers who make multiple purchases / all customers

Churn rate: 1 - repeat rate

Purchase frequency: total transactions / total number of unique customers

Average order value: total price / total transactions

Customer value: average order value * purchase frequency

Profit margin: total price * profit margin rate(provided by the company)

CLV = (customer value / churn rate) * profit margin

Customers are segmented based on the generated CLV value, and operations are carried out according to these segments.
